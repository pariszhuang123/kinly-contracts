# Kinly Preference Interpretation & Scenarios Contract v1

Status: Proposed (MVP)

Scope: Home-only personal preference capture, interpretation, and aggregation.

Audience: Product, design, engineering, AI agents.

Depends on:
- Preference Taxonomy v1
- Home Dynamics Contract v1

1. Purpose

This contract defines how personal preferences are expressed, interpreted, and
safely aggregated in Kinly.

It standardizes:
- scenario-based preference capture
- implicit preference intensity (without numeric strength)
- non-enforceable interpretation rules
- aggregation constraints into Home Vibe

This contract applies only to personal preferences. It does not define rules,
permissions, enforcement, or eligibility.

2. Core Principles

2.1 Nature of Preferences
- Preferences are self-reported comfort ranges, not demands.
- Preferences are descriptive, not prescriptive.
- Preferences do not imply obligation, permission, or enforcement.
- Preferences do not auto-convert into rules.

2.2 Intensity & Strength (Explicit Clarification)
- Preference "intensity" reflects how narrow or wide a person's comfort range is.
- Intensity is implicit, derived from the selected option.
- Intensity is not priority, importance, or urgency.
- No preference is treated as more valid than another.
- Strongly felt preferences must surface via phrasing, not policy.

2.3 Absence & Silence
- Absence of a preference implies flexibility, not indifference.
- Users are never penalized for skipping preferences.

3. Scenario-Based Capture Model

3.1 Structure
Each preference is captured via:
- One contextual scenario.
- Exactly three response options.
- Ordered from narrow comfort -> balanced -> wide comfort (or inverse where
  appropriate).
- Option index maps to `preference_taxonomy_defs.value_keys` in order (0..2).

No scenario may:
- Use enforcement language.
- Ask for deal-breakers.
- Ask users to rank importance.
- Reference other people's behavior.

4. Canonical Preference Scenarios (v1)

Each scenario maps 1:1 to a taxonomy ID.

5. Interpretation Rules (AI + Product)
- Preferences must be interpreted in aggregate only.
- Never surface single-user preferences when member count < 3.
- Never phrase outputs as instructions.
- Never infer compliance, responsibility, or fault.
- Mixed extremes must be phrased as "varied" or "mixed".

Approved phrasing patterns:
- "Some people here prefer..."
- "This home tends to..."
- "Preferences vary across the home..."

6. Aggregation Constraints
- Preferences may inform Home Vibe, not Home Rules.
- Aggregation is distribution-aware, never winner-takes-all.
- Recalculation occurs on: member join, member leave, preference update.

7. Explicit Non-goals
- No numeric strength or priority fields.
- No deal-breakers.
- No identity, medical, or diagnostic inference.
- No gating, enforcement, or eligibility logic.
- No automatic rule suggestion.

8. Governance & Versioning

Owners:
- Product: semantic meaning and scope.
- Design: phrasing and UX safety.
- Engineering: schema and enforcement.
- Docs: versioning and change log.

Versioning:
- Scenario wording may change without version bump.
- Taxonomy IDs are immutable.
- New scenarios require v2 + ADR.
- Deprecations must be non-breaking.

9. Contract Schema (Reference)

```contracts-json
{
  "domain": "preference_scenarios",
  "version": "v1",
  "entities": {
    "PreferenceScenario": {
      "id": "text",
      "domain": "text",
      "scenario": "text",

    }
  },

}
```

Final Note

This contract intentionally does not try to capture everything. It captures what
is safe, stable, and meaningful at home scale. That restraint is a feature, not
a limitation.
