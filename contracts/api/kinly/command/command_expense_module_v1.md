# Command Expense Module Contract v1.0

## 1. Purpose

This module receives router module input with `source_intent: "create_expense"` and extracts expense/bill fields. It produces a module envelope that the executor layer uses to create an expense via the expenses RPC contract.

This module ALWAYS requires a second LLM call (scoped prompt) because amount and participant extraction from natural language needs structured understanding. There is no regex shortcut.

---

## 2. Parsing Strategy

Always **Step 2** (LLM, scoped prompt). No Step 1 regex attempt.

The LLM prompt is small and tightly scoped:

> "From this text, extract: amount, category, participants, who paid."

The LLM returns raw extracted values only. Currency, membership validation, and split resolution are handled deterministically by the module — NEVER by the LLM.

### LLM extraction schema

The LLM MUST return a JSON object in this exact shape:

```json
{
  "amount": 84,
  "category": "groceries",
  "participant_tokens": ["all_scope_members"],
  "paid_by_token": "current_user",
  "allocation_target_type": "debtor_based",
  "split_mode": "equal",
  "custom_splits": []
}
```

Schema rules:

- `amount` is a number or `null`
- `category` is a string or `null`
- `participant_tokens` is an array of raw participant references or canonical tokens
- `paid_by_token` is a raw payer reference or canonical token
- `allocation_target_type` MUST be one of `"debtor_based"` or `"unit_based"` when the user stated the target mode; otherwise `null`
- `split_mode` MUST be one of `"equal"` or `"custom"` when the user stated the split style; otherwise `null`
- `custom_splits` is an array of `{ "token": string, "amount": number|null, "percent": number|null }`

The module MUST normalize synonymous phrases before validation:

- `"everyone"`, `"everybody"`, `"all"`, `"all of us"`, `"the whole house"` -> `all_scope_members`
- `"me"`, `"I"`, `"myself"` -> `current_user`
- Percentage-based utterances MAY be converted by the module into custom exact amounts before RPC execution

---

## 3. Field Schema

| Field | Type | Source | Rule |
|-------|------|--------|------|
| `amount` | number | LLM extraction | Required — MUST be explicitly stated by user. If not stated, `status = missing_fields` |
| `currency` | string | Home settings DB lookup | NEVER from LLM. NEVER guessed. Always from home configuration |
| `category` | string? | LLM extraction | Optional, e.g. `"groceries"`, `"utilities"` |
| `allocation_target_type` | string | LLM extraction + module defaults | MUST be `"debtor_based"` or `"unit_based"` before execution |
| `split_mode` | string | LLM extraction + module defaults | MUST map to downstream `ExpenseSplitType` values `"equal"` or `"custom"` |
| `participants` | string[] | LLM extraction + membership validation | Min 2 debtors for `debtor_based`; `all_scope_members` resolves via module rules |
| `unit_ids` | string[] | Unit resolution | Used only when `allocation_target_type == "unit_based"` |
| `paid_by` | string | LLM extraction or default | Defaults to `current_user` if not stated |
| `custom_splits` | object[] | LLM extraction + module derivation | Required when `split_mode == "custom"` |

---

## 4. Split Rules

> **This section is critical for correct expense creation.**

- The module MUST align with `expenses_v2.md`:
  - `allocation_target_type = "debtor_based"` targets individual home members
  - `allocation_target_type = "unit_based"` targets one or more home units
- The backend MUST NOT infer allocation mode from shopping-list scope or active shared-unit membership
- If the user explicitly indicates unit-based splitting, the module MUST resolve concrete `unit_ids`
- If the user explicitly indicates individual splitting, the module MUST resolve concrete member IDs
- If the user uses `all_scope_members` without specifying target mode:
  - default to `debtor_based`
  - resolve to all current home members
- `paid_by` MUST be included in debtor-based participant resolution when the payer shares the expense
- Minimum 2 debtors required for debtor-based equal or custom splits
- Unit-based allocation MAY target a shared unit plus one or more personal units, for example `50%` to a couple unit and `25%` each to two individual units
- Internal cost sharing inside a shared unit remains out of scope; the unit is the debtor
- Owner is NOT excluded from splits

### Percentage to exact amount conversion

If the user expresses percentages, the module MAY parse them but MUST convert them into exact custom amounts before execution.

Conversion rules:

- Percentages MUST sum to `100`
- Conversion MUST happen in minor currency units
- Round down each share except the last
- Assign any remainder to the last share so the total matches the stated amount exactly
- The outgoing RPC payload still uses downstream `split_mode = "custom"`

---

## 5. Validation Rules

- `amount` MUST be > 0
- `amount` MUST be explicitly stated (MUST NOT be inferred)
- `currency` MUST come from home settings (MUST NOT be guessed or LLM-extracted)
- `allocation_target_type` MUST be chosen before execution
- `split_mode` MUST be chosen before execution
- For `debtor_based`, `participants.length` MUST be >= 2
- For `debtor_based`, `paid_by` MUST be in `participants` when payer shares the bill
- If `participants` includes non-members of the home -> `status = ambiguous`
- For `unit_based`, every `unit_id` MUST belong to the same home and be active
- For `split_mode == "custom"`, exact amounts MUST sum to the total amount

---

## 6. Decision Rules

Deterministic, priority-ordered. First match wins.

| Priority | Condition | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `amount` is missing | `missing_fields` -> `inline` (ask for amount) |
| 2 | `allocation_target_type` or `split_mode` cannot be resolved safely | `ambiguous` -> `confirm` or `route` |
| 3 | Participants or unit targets cannot be resolved | `ambiguous` -> `inline` or `route` |
| 4 | `status == complete` (all fields present and valid) | `confirm` (ALWAYS) |

`risk_level` is ALWAYS `"high"` for expenses. Expenses MUST ALWAYS require confirmation, regardless of confidence. Auto-execute is never permitted.

---

## 7. Examples

### A. Complete expense with shared unit

User says: `"groceries 84 split all"`

Home has a shared unit `unit_abc_123` with members represented as a unit debtor

```json

  "contract_version": "1.1",
  "request_id": "req_exp_001",
  "source_intent": "create_expense",

### B. Complete expense without shared unit
