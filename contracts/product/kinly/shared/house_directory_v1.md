# House Directory Contract v1

Status: Proposed

Scope: Shared home operational reference data for wifi access, home services,
house notes, and due renewal reminders derived from service terms.

Audience: Product, design, engineering, AI agents.

Depends on:
- Homes v2 (membership and role model)
- Personal Directory capability (separate person-scoped information)
- House Norms capability (separate behavior/social agreements)

## 1. Purpose

House Directory provides a structured source of truth for shared household
operations.

House Directory MUST support:
- wifi access details
- home service references
- simple shared house notes and tutorials
- member cards for navigating to personal-directory surfaces
- due renewal reminders for time-bound services

## 2. Scope and boundaries

In scope:
- shared home operations, not person-specific records
- optional URL references attached to service or house-note records
- one optional photo attachment per house note
- derived member cards for current home members who have published
  personal-directory content
- reminder timing derived from service term windows and configured offsets
- per-member acknowledgement of due reminders

Out of scope:
- House Norms content and workflows
- standalone House Rules policy workflows
- personal bank/emergency/document records
- enterprise/hidden-network wifi QR variants

## 3. Core entities

### 3.1 Wifi profile
- A home MAY have at most one wifi profile.
- Wifi profile includes `ssid` and optional `password`.
- Raw password MAY be stored server-side for owner updates and QR generation.
- Public/member RPC reads MUST NOT return the raw password.
- QR payload is derived from stored wifi values.

### 3.2 Home service
- Represents one shared home service record:
  - `rent`
  - `internet`
  - `electricity`
  - `gas`
  - `water`
  - `other`
- `service_type='internet'` is distinct from the wifi credentials profile.
- `other` requires non-empty `custom_label`.
- Each service includes `provider_name`, optional `account_reference`,
  optional `link_url`, optional term dates, optional reminder offset, and
  optional notes.
- `rent` MUST include both `term_start_date` and `term_end_date`.
- Services and notes are soft-archived with `archived_at`.
- Active service uniqueness is enforced for:
  - one active `rent` per home
  - one active `internet` per home
  - one active `electricity` per home

### 3.3 House note
- Represents simple free-form home reference information that does not fit a
  service row.
- Each note includes:
  - `title`
  - optional `details`
  - `note_type` — either `general` or `tutorial` (default `general`)
  - optional `reference_url`
  - optional `photo_path`
- `note_type` determines UI grouping:
  - `general` — standard household notes (move-in instructions, parking
    details, alarm steps, access guidance)
  - `tutorial` — appliance how-tos, troubleshooting guides, video walkthroughs
- If `reference_url` is present it MUST be a valid `http` or `https` URL.
- `photo_path` is a storage reference under `households/%`, not a public CDN URL.
- A note MAY exist without a URL or photo.
- Notes are soft-archived with `archived_at`.
- At most one photo is attached per active note row in v1.
- Adding the first photo to a note enforces a paywall-limited usage metric for non-premium homes.
- Replacing an existing photo MUST NOT increment photo usage again.
- Clearing or archiving a note photo does not decrement that usage metric.

### 3.4 Renewal reminder
- Renewal reminders are derived, not user-authored.
- Reminder eligibility requires:
  - active service row
  - both `term_start_date` and `term_end_date`
  - valid reminder offset or default offset
- Default reminder timing is `3 months` before `term_end_date`.
- Allowed explicit units are `day`, `week`, `month`.
- `term_end_date` is inclusive in v1.
- A due reminder is actionable only when current UTC date is on or after
  `due_at`.

### 3.5 Reminder acknowledgement
- A due reminder MAY be acknowledged by each current member independently.
- Acknowledgement hides that reminder from that member’s due-reminder list.
- Material reminder changes reopen visibility by clearing acknowledgements.

### 3.6 Member card
- Member cards are derived, not stored.
- A member card is shown only for a current member whose personal directory
  has any content.
- Personal-directory content means at least one of:
  - a bank account row exists
  - at least one active personal note exists
- Each card includes:
  - `user_id`
  - `username`
  - `avatar_storage_path`
  - `is_owner`
  - `has_personal_directory_content`
- Cards are used as the entry point from House Directory to Personal
  Directory.
- Cards are ordered with owner first, then by username.

## 4. Reminder lifecycle invariants

- Reminder identity is scoped to:
  - `service_id`
  - `reminder_kind`
  - `term_start_date`
  - `term_end_date`
- Dismissal is owner-driven and applies to the reminder row.
- Acknowledgement is member-specific and does not dismiss the reminder globally.
- If term dates or reminder timing change materially, the reminder is reopened
  as `active` and prior acknowledgements are cleared.
- If a service is archived or no valid due date exists, reminder rows are
  retained as `retired`.
- If current UTC date is before `due_at`, the reminder is not actionable in
  Today.

## 5. Access and privacy rules

- Read access:
  - wifi read: current home members on active homes
  - directory content read: current home members on active homes
  - member cards read: current home members on active homes
  - due reminders read: current home members on active homes
- Write access:
  - wifi/service/note create-update-archive: current home owner only
  - reminder dismiss: current home owner only
  - reminder acknowledge: current home members
- Wifi password is sensitive operational data:
  - storage is allowed for home operations
  - UI SHOULD mask by default when displayed outside explicit reveal flow
  - value MUST NOT be emitted to telemetry payloads
  - public/member read RPCs MUST NOT return the raw password

## 6. Cross-capability relationships

- House Directory stores shared operational facts.
- House Directory exposes the filtered member-card read surface used to
  navigate to person-scoped surfaces.
- Homes v2 remains the source of membership truth and owner state.
- House Norms stores shared behavioral expectations.
- Personal Directory stores person-specific records.
- Contracts MUST remain separated; cross-links are allowed, duplication is not.

## 7. Contract test scenarios

- Non-owner cannot mutate wifi, services, notes, or dismiss reminders.
- Member can read wifi/content and acknowledge due reminders.
- Member can read member cards for current home members who have personal
  directory content.
- Wifi read returns `ssid` and `qr_payload` but not raw password.
- Rent service creation without term dates is rejected.
- House note creation without `title` is rejected.
- House note with invalid `note_type` is rejected.
- Content reads return services, notes, and tutorials as three separate sections.
- House note URL must be valid when present.
- First note photo add enforces the note-photo paywall limit on non-premium homes; replacement does not
  add a second usage charge.
- Clearing or archiving a note photo does not free prior note-photo usage.
- Invalid reminder offset pair or out-of-range offset is rejected.
- A due reminder appears when current UTC date is on or after `due_at`.
- Member acknowledgement hides the reminder only for that member.
- Owner dismissal removes the reminder from due-reminder results.
- Archiving a service retires its reminder and removes it from content reads.
- Archived notes are excluded from content reads.
- Members without personal-directory content are excluded from member-card
  results.
- Owner card includes owner flag, username, and avatar path.
