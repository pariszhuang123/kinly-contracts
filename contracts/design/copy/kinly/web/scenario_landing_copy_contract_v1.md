# Kinly Scenario Landing Copy Contract v1.0

Purpose: Keep scenario landing pages warm, reassuring, and crystal clear about what Kinly is and how it works.

## Goal (must achieve)
Generate landing copy that is emotionally warm **and** explicitly explains what Kinly does.

## Non-negotiables
- MUST define Kinly as a **shared living app**.
- MUST explain the mechanism: (1) expectations, (2) weekly rhythm, (3) shared visibility.
- MUST avoid “task manager / enforcement” framing.
- Features like chores or bills MUST be secondary and optional support.

## Required sections (in order)
1. **Recognition (scenario-specific)** — Empathize with the scenario tension.
2. **Hero (benefit + fear removal)** — Promise relief without implying policing.
3. **What Kinly Is** — Include the mandatory sentence below.
4. **How Kinly Works** — Outline the 3-step mechanism.
5. **Supported by Practical Tools (optional, guarded)** — Only after alignment is clear.
6. **Not-list** — Explicitly state anti-surveillance / no enforcement.
7. **Availability** — Where to get Kinly.

## Language guardrails
- Allowed verbs: agree, align, clarify, support, reduce, surface, keep calm, reset.
- Forbidden verbs: assign, enforce, manage, track, control, monitor, score.
- Use invitational tone; avoid commands that feel like policing.

## Mandatory sentence (What Kinly Is)
“Kinly is a shared living app designed for people who live together.”

## Mandatory intro (Supported by tools)
When section 5 is included: “Once expectations are aligned, Kinly offers simple tools that reduce everyday friction — without turning shared living into a task system.”

## Tailoring rules
- Scenario pages MAY change examples (guests, noise, routines, bills) and emphasis.
- Scenario pages MUST NOT change Kinly’s identity or lead with features.

## Final validation checklist (use before publish)
- Can a reader explain Kinly in one sentence?
- Is “shared living app” stated explicitly?
- Are chores/bills framed as optional support after alignment?
- Does the copy avoid policing or surveillance vibes?
